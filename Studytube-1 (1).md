Today, I dedicated time to create a weekly plan, opting to use GitHub as my platform of choice. I plan to try to integrate it with Powerpages by this Friday. Additionally, I conducted research to identify relevant LinkedIn certificates for the current semester. Ultimately, I discovered a certification program titled "Career Essentials in Software Development by Microsoft and LinkedIn" (There is a link in the Reference section). The certificate consists of three different courses. 1. Introduction to Career Skills in Software Development 2. Programming Foundations: Fundamentals 3. Programming Foundations: Beyond the Fundamentals (See picture in the dropdown menu "Pictures/video")

<summary> Describtion</summary>
<br>

Today marked the inaugural day of the course, where I delved into the subject of "Introduction to Career Skills in Software Development." This session was expertly presented by Annyce Davis.(There is a picture of the her in the dropdown menu)

The course encompassed fundamental concepts of the software development profession, including an exploration of various roles, programming languages, and practical coding exercises. To cap off the course, I completed an examination, the details of which can be found in the picture dropdown. Additionally, there will be code snippets from the exercises. While I found the course somewhat straightforward, I believe it was still beneficial in reinvigorating my coding skills.

Today was the first day of the course-learning and the topic was: Introduction to Career Skills in Software Development and was presented by Annyce Davis.

The course contained the basic idea of being a software developer, different roles, programming languages and also some hands-on coding examples. I ended the course by doing an exam, that i will show in the picture dropdown. There will also be code snippets of the exercises. I think the course was a little easy, but i still think it benefitted me and freshened up my coding skills.

<summary> Describtion</summary>
<br>
On day two of my certificate course i got reintroduced to different coding fundamentals such as, Basic statements and expressions, variables and data, int/str, conditions and making/ calling funtions. This course started out being very easy, but in the end was a little more challenging. The course consited of both theory and practice (exercises). The exercises was available for download on the course site. 
The presenter of the course today was also, Annyce Davis, and the name of the course was: Programming Foundations: Fundamentals.

![course 2](https://github.com/jona937d/4_semester_jona21m9/assets/92019351/50d3bd99-907d-419a-a263-cd81356457d9)

unlike yesterday, there where no "verification" or exam for finishing the course.

Exercise 1: playing with if/else statements

<img width="380" alt="Skærmbillede 2023-09-27 113303" src="https://github.com/jona937d/4_semester_jona21m9/assets/92019351/0534a2c7-ffbe-48d1-b99a-3df29efd09fe">

Exercise 2: In this exercise i wanted to make it a bit more complicated. In the original, any answear other than "yes" would result in the answer "Oh no! That makes me sad!". so i "stored" different answers in lists and added an option for the program, if none of the "elements" where typed ("thats not an answer").

Exercise 3: In this exercise i had to make a funtion and call it 3 different times. my solution compared to the one from the course what a bit more complicated, but it worked.
