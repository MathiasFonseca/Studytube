Today, I dedicated time to create a weekly plan, opting to use GitHub as my platform of choice. I plan to try to integrate it with Powerpages by this Friday. Additionally, I conducted research to identify relevant LinkedIn certificates for the current semester. Ultimately, I discovered a certification program titled "Career Essentials in Software Development by Microsoft and LinkedIn" (There is a link in the Reference section). The certificate consists of three different courses. 1. Introduction to Career Skills in Software Development 2. Programming Foundations: Fundamentals 3. Programming Foundations: Beyond the Fundamentals (See picture in the dropdown menu "Pictures/video")

Bolean: 


Boolean, or Boolean logic, is a fundamental concept in computer science and mathematics that deals with the manipulation and representation of binary values, which can only have one of two possible states: true or false, often represented as 1 and 0, respectively. Boolean logic is named after the mathematician and logician George Boole, who developed the algebraic system in the mid-19th century.

In Boolean logic, there are three basic logical operations: AND, OR, and NOT. These operations allow you to combine and manipulate true and false values to make decisions, evaluate conditions, and perform various logical tasks. Here's a brief explanation of each of these operations:

AND Operation: The AND operation returns true (1) only when both of its operands are true (1). In other words, it produces a true result if and only if all the conditions being checked are true.

Example:

True AND True = True
True AND False = False
False AND True = False
False AND False = False
OR Operation: The OR operation returns true (1) if at least one of its operands is true (1). It produces a false result only if both operands are false (0).

Example:

True OR True = True
True OR False = True
False OR True = True
False OR False = False
NOT Operation: The NOT operation negates the input boolean value. It returns true (1) if the input is false (0), and it returns false (0) if the input is true (1).

Example:

NOT True = False
NOT False = True
Boolean logic is essential in computer programming and digital electronics because it forms the basis for decision-making and conditional statements. In programming, you often use Boolean variables and expressions to control the flow of a program, perform comparisons, and make decisions. For example, you might use Boolean variables to check if a condition is met and then execute specific code based on whether the condition is true or false.

Here's a simple Python example:

<img width="515" alt="Skærmbillede 2023-09-29 kl  16 05 03" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/dec0a707-f73a-44a1-9c56-2eb9d8c4c7b9">

    
In this example, Boolean variables (is_raining and is_sunny) are used to determine the weather conditions, and Boolean logic is used in the if statements to decide what message to print based on the conditions.



function def: 

In Python, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. Functions are defined using the def keyword and can take input values (parameters), process them, and optionally return a result. They allow you to organize your code into smaller, more manageable pieces and promote code reuse. Here's a short summary:

A function in Python is defined using the def keyword.
It can have parameters (input values) that are passed to it.
The function body contains the code that defines what the function does.
Functions can optionally return a result using the return statement.
You can call (use) a function in your code by its name, passing arguments as needed.
Example of a simple Python function:

<img width="662" alt="Skærmbillede 2023-09-29 kl  16 10 11" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/7723ab22-8b44-4c28-9480-f0e4afebeb2f">

classes: 

In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, and it defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have. Here's a short explanation:

Blueprint for Objects: A class serves as a template or blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that objects created from the class will possess.

Attributes: Attributes are variables that store data specific to each object created from the class. These attributes are also known as instance variables.

Methods: Methods are functions defined within the class that define the behavior of the class and its objects. They can operate on the attributes of the class and perform various actions.

Objects: Objects are instances of a class. When you create an object from a class, you are essentially creating a specific instance of that class with its own set of attributes and the ability to call its methods.

Here's a simple example of a Python class:

<img width="676" alt="Skærmbillede 2023-09-29 kl  16 11 32" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/f3aec066-a809-4117-ae3e-cafa61ea8d10">

In this example, we define a Dog class with attributes (name and age) and a method (bark). We then create two Dog objects, dog1 and dog2, each with its own set of attributes. We access the attributes and call the bark method on these objects.

Classes are fundamental to object-oriented programming in Python, and they help you organize and encapsulate your code into reusable and logical units.

adding modules: 

In Python, a module is a file containing Python code, typically consisting of functions, classes, and variables. Modules are used to organize and separate code into reusable components. Here's a short explanation:

Code Organization: Modules help you organize your Python code by grouping related functions, classes, and variables into separate files. Each module can focus on a specific aspect of your program.

Code Reusability: Modules enable code reuse. You can import functions, classes, and variables from one module into another, allowing you to use the same code in multiple parts of your program.

Namespace: Modules create a separate namespace for their contents, preventing naming conflicts. You can use modules to avoid naming clashes between different parts of your program.

Standard Library: Python comes with a rich standard library of modules that provide pre-built functionality for various tasks, such as file handling, data manipulation, and networking.

Here's a basic example of how to use a module:

Suppose you have a file named my_module.py containing the following code:

my_module.py

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
You can then import and use the greet function from this module in another Python script:

main.py

import my_module

message = my_module.greet("Alice")
print(message)  # This will print "Hello, Alice!"
In this example, my_module.py is a module, and we import the greet function from it into main.py. This allows us to use the greet function in our main program.

Modules are a fundamental concept in Python, helping you structure your code and make it more modular and maintainable. They are essential for building large and complex Python applications.

On the second day of my certificate course, I underwent a refresher on essential coding fundamentals, including basic statements and expressions, variables and data types, integers and strings, conditions, and the creation and invocation of functions. The course initially began on a rather straightforward note but gradually grew more challenging as it progressed. It featured a balanced blend of theoretical content and practical exercises, with downloadable exercise materials available on the course website. 
 
Annyce Davis continued to be the course presenter for the day, and the course was aptly titled "Programming Foundations: Fundamentals."

Todays focus was if/else statements 

What is an if statement?

Notes: An if statement is like making a decision in your code. Imagine you're choosing between two paths in a maze. If you take the left path (if something is true), you'll do one thing, and if you take the right path (if something is false), you'll do something else.

Basic Syntax:

In Python, we write if statements like this:

<img width="675" alt="image" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/71945d7c-24a3-437d-a4d8-cebf5520cab5">

You use if followed by a condition (like checking if a number is greater than another) and then a colon. The indented code under it runs only if the condition is true.

What is an else statement?

Now, what if there's a different action you want to take if the condition is false? That's where else comes in. It's like a backup plan.

Basic Syntax with else:

<img width="552" alt="image" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/6eb636a5-605f-4560-8c3c-1ed00a1648ca">

You can think of if as "Do this if it's true," and else as "Do this if it's not true."

Putting it Together:

Here's an example:

<img width="540" alt="image" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/748d2a1c-8d78-4d5f-9823-471ad9ecd38e">

In this case, if the age is 18 or older (the condition is true), it prints "You are an adult." If not, it prints "You are not an adult."

On the third day of the program, we had the privilege of being instructed by none other than Sasha Vodnik, who holds the esteemed position of Principal Technical Course Developer at DocuSign. The focal point of the session revolved around the theme of "Programming Foundations: Exploring Beyond the Basics."


This particular course presented a somewhat elevated level of complexity, requiring a bit more effort and concentration on my part. However, I found that with diligence and a focused approach, I was able to not only manage the challenges but also gain a comprehensive understanding of the content.

What set this course apart was the depth to which it explored various programming concepts. It took us beyond the foundational knowledge provided in the preceding two courses and introduced us to a more advanced set of methods and theories. Despite the increased complexity, I noticed that the strong foundation I had built from the earlier courses played a crucial role in facilitating my progress. It was evident that those fundamental concepts still had a significant impact on my ability to grasp the more advanced material and apply it effectively when working on the exercises.

Throughout the course, we delved into a diverse range of topics. These included constructing and effectively utilizing collections, mastering iterations and loops, harnessing the power of external code through functions, manipulating strings with finesse, honing debugging skills, and immersing ourselves in object-oriented programming principles.

What greatly contributed to my understanding of these concepts was Sasha's teaching approach. She had a knack for elucidating complex theoretical ideas by using relatable, everyday, and no-code visual examples. This teaching style made the content accessible and allowed me to bridge the gap between theory and practical application with confidence.

In conclusion, while this course presented its challenges, I am pleased to report that it was a rewarding experience. It pushed me to expand my programming horizons, building upon the solid foundation laid in the earlier courses. The diverse array of topics covered and Sasha's effective teaching methods left me with a deeper understanding of programming fundamentals beyond the basics.

Creating a simple dictionary in Python is quite straightforward. A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value. Here's how you can create a dictionary and print its values:

<img width="384" alt="image" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/4275134d-6d59-4b30-8600-edf9fd354b7c">

In this example:

We create a dictionary named my_dict with three key-value pairs.
The keys are strings ("name," "age," and "city"), and the values associated with each key are also of various types (a string, an integer, and another string).
To access the values in the dictionary, you use square brackets [] with the key as the index. For example, my_dict["name"] accesses the value associated with the key "name," which is "John."

When you run this code, it will print the values associated with each key in the dictionary:

<img width="218" alt="image" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/4fe4d509-2cdb-4b70-97ed-104bab774fb3">

You can also modify the values in a dictionary or add new key-value pairs as needed. Dictionaries are versatile and widely used in Python for various data storage and retrieval tasks.

A "while loop" in Python repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition remains true. Indentation is used to define the scope of the code within the loop. The loop continues until the condition evaluates to False. Avoid creating infinite loops.

Example:

<img width="234" alt="image" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/ceae9fee-56f5-4fe5-b6c4-047f253984d1">

In this example, the loop prints values from 0 to 4 because it runs as long as count is less than 5.

In Python, you can use a "for loop" to iterate through elements in a list and perform an action on each element.

Example:

<img width="390" alt="image" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/2eae7cd4-cc75-4ec4-923d-0c7873786fb8">

In this example, the "for loop" iterates through the fruits list and prints each fruit one by one.

To import an existing module from another file in Python, you can use the import statement. Here's a brief explanation with an example:

Suppose you have a Python file named my_module.py with the following content:


<img width="348" alt="image" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/9db3ae7f-37b8-4797-a1ad-2904e6d8b1cb">

Now, you want to import and use the greet function from my_module.py in another file, say main.py:

<img width="414" alt="image" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/2b9e93b4-43f7-42b8-a8ae-f892fa70196b">

In this example:

We use the import statement to import the my_module module into the main.py file.

After importing, you can access functions and variables defined in my_module using the module_name.function_name syntax. Here, we call the greet function from my_module and store its result in the message variable.

Finally, we print the message variable to display the greeting.

When you run main.py, it will import my_module.py, call the greet function, and print the greeting message:


<img width="177" alt="image" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/ef345028-02c5-44ee-8e1e-08fa4a13dafe">

This is how you can import and use functions and variables from one Python file in another using the import statement.


Certainly! Debugging is an essential skill in programming, where you identify and fix issues in your code. Let's walk through an example where we have a buggy Python code snippet and fix it:

Original buggy code:

<img width="604" alt="image" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/59190e01-d1c9-477c-b9f3-da0a348747d3">

The issues in the original code are as follows:

The range function should include 10 if we want to find the sum of even numbers from 1 to 10.
The loop condition should be for i in range(1, 11): to include 10.
The loop is summing odd numbers instead of even numbers because of the incorrect if condition.

Here's the corrected code:

<img width="565" alt="image" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/26efe7c4-e0d8-464e-a002-5efe861c9d8e">

In this corrected code:

We've changed the range to range(1, 11) to include the number 10 in the iteration.

The if condition i % 2 == 0 checks if the number is even before adding it to sum_even.

Now, the code will correctly calculate and print the sum of even numbers from 1 to 10.

When you run the corrected code, it will output:


<img width="265" alt="image" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/577fdd60-fa7e-43da-998a-8ca595063f16">

This demonstrates how debugging involves identifying and fixing issues in the code to achieve the desired functionality.
