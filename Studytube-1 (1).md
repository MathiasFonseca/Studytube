Today, I dedicated time to create a weekly plan, opting to use GitHub as my platform of choice. I plan to try to integrate it with Powerpages by this Friday. Additionally, I conducted research to identify relevant LinkedIn certificates for the current semester. Ultimately, I discovered a certification program titled "Career Essentials in Software Development by Microsoft and LinkedIn" (There is a link in the Reference section). The certificate consists of three different courses. 1. Introduction to Career Skills in Software Development 2. Programming Foundations: Fundamentals 3. Programming Foundations: Beyond the Fundamentals (See picture in the dropdown menu "Pictures/video")

Today marked the inaugural day of the course, where I delved into the subject of "Introduction to Career Skills in Software Development." This session was expertly presented by Annyce Davis.(There is a picture of the her in the dropdown menu)

The course encompassed fundamental concepts of the software development profession, including an exploration of various roles, programming languages, and practical coding exercises. To cap off the course, I completed an examination, the details of which can be found in the picture dropdown. Additionally, there will be code snippets from the exercises. While I found the course somewhat straightforward, I believe it was still beneficial in reinvigorating my coding skills.

Bolean: 


Boolean, or Boolean logic, is a fundamental concept in computer science and mathematics that deals with the manipulation and representation of binary values, which can only have one of two possible states: true or false, often represented as 1 and 0, respectively. Boolean logic is named after the mathematician and logician George Boole, who developed the algebraic system in the mid-19th century.

In Boolean logic, there are three basic logical operations: AND, OR, and NOT. These operations allow you to combine and manipulate true and false values to make decisions, evaluate conditions, and perform various logical tasks. Here's a brief explanation of each of these operations:

AND Operation: The AND operation returns true (1) only when both of its operands are true (1). In other words, it produces a true result if and only if all the conditions being checked are true.

Example:

True AND True = True
True AND False = False
False AND True = False
False AND False = False
OR Operation: The OR operation returns true (1) if at least one of its operands is true (1). It produces a false result only if both operands are false (0).

Example:

True OR True = True
True OR False = True
False OR True = True
False OR False = False
NOT Operation: The NOT operation negates the input boolean value. It returns true (1) if the input is false (0), and it returns false (0) if the input is true (1).

Example:

NOT True = False
NOT False = True
Boolean logic is essential in computer programming and digital electronics because it forms the basis for decision-making and conditional statements. In programming, you often use Boolean variables and expressions to control the flow of a program, perform comparisons, and make decisions. For example, you might use Boolean variables to check if a condition is met and then execute specific code based on whether the condition is true or false.

Here's a simple Python example:

<img width="515" alt="Skærmbillede 2023-09-29 kl  16 05 03" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/dec0a707-f73a-44a1-9c56-2eb9d8c4c7b9">

    
In this example, Boolean variables (is_raining and is_sunny) are used to determine the weather conditions, and Boolean logic is used in the if statements to decide what message to print based on the conditions.



function def: 

In Python, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. Functions are defined using the def keyword and can take input values (parameters), process them, and optionally return a result. They allow you to organize your code into smaller, more manageable pieces and promote code reuse. Here's a short summary:

A function in Python is defined using the def keyword.
It can have parameters (input values) that are passed to it.
The function body contains the code that defines what the function does.
Functions can optionally return a result using the return statement.
You can call (use) a function in your code by its name, passing arguments as needed.
Example of a simple Python function:

<img width="662" alt="Skærmbillede 2023-09-29 kl  16 10 11" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/7723ab22-8b44-4c28-9480-f0e4afebeb2f">

classes: 

In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, and it defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have. Here's a short explanation:

Blueprint for Objects: A class serves as a template or blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that objects created from the class will possess.

Attributes: Attributes are variables that store data specific to each object created from the class. These attributes are also known as instance variables.

Methods: Methods are functions defined within the class that define the behavior of the class and its objects. They can operate on the attributes of the class and perform various actions.

Objects: Objects are instances of a class. When you create an object from a class, you are essentially creating a specific instance of that class with its own set of attributes and the ability to call its methods.

Here's a simple example of a Python class:

<img width="676" alt="Skærmbillede 2023-09-29 kl  16 11 32" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/f3aec066-a809-4117-ae3e-cafa61ea8d10">

In this example, we define a Dog class with attributes (name and age) and a method (bark). We then create two Dog objects, dog1 and dog2, each with its own set of attributes. We access the attributes and call the bark method on these objects.

Classes are fundamental to object-oriented programming in Python, and they help you organize and encapsulate your code into reusable and logical units.

adding modules: 

In Python, a module is a file containing Python code, typically consisting of functions, classes, and variables. Modules are used to organize and separate code into reusable components. Here's a short explanation:

Code Organization: Modules help you organize your Python code by grouping related functions, classes, and variables into separate files. Each module can focus on a specific aspect of your program.

Code Reusability: Modules enable code reuse. You can import functions, classes, and variables from one module into another, allowing you to use the same code in multiple parts of your program.

Namespace: Modules create a separate namespace for their contents, preventing naming conflicts. You can use modules to avoid naming clashes between different parts of your program.

Standard Library: Python comes with a rich standard library of modules that provide pre-built functionality for various tasks, such as file handling, data manipulation, and networking.

Here's a basic example of how to use a module:

Suppose you have a file named my_module.py containing the following code:

my_module.py

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
You can then import and use the greet function from this module in another Python script:

main.py

import my_module

message = my_module.greet("Alice")
print(message)  # This will print "Hello, Alice!"
In this example, my_module.py is a module, and we import the greet function from it into main.py. This allows us to use the greet function in our main program.

Modules are a fundamental concept in Python, helping you structure your code and make it more modular and maintainable. They are essential for building large and complex Python applications.

<summary> Describtion</summary>
<br>
On the second day of my certificate course, I underwent a refresher on essential coding fundamentals, including basic statements and expressions, variables and data types, integers and strings, conditions, and the creation and invocation of functions. The course initially began on a rather straightforward note but gradually grew more challenging as it progressed. It featured a balanced blend of theoretical content and practical exercises, with downloadable exercise materials available on the course website. 
 
Annyce Davis continued to be the course presenter for the day, and the course was aptly titled "Programming Foundations: Fundamentals."

Todays focus was if/else statements 

What is an if statement?

Notes: An if statement is like making a decision in your code. Imagine you're choosing between two paths in a maze. If you take the left path (if something is true), you'll do one thing, and if you take the right path (if something is false), you'll do something else.

Basic Syntax:

In Python, we write if statements like this:

<img width="675" alt="image" src="https://github.com/MathiasFonseca/Studytube/assets/92019457/71945d7c-24a3-437d-a4d8-cebf5520cab5">

You use if followed by a condition (like checking if a number is greater than another) and then a colon. The indented code under it runs only if the condition is true.

What is an else statement?

Now, what if there's a different action you want to take if the condition is false? That's where else comes in. It's like a backup plan.

Basic Syntax with else:
